AI Studio Project completed in Fall 2022 for the Break Through Tech AI program, an 18-month immersive program at Cornell Tech 
that encompasses real-world artificial intelligence applications and industry mentorship. I received the ML Foundations certificate 
from Cornell University after completing weekly assignments and labs that elaborated on building data analysis pipelines and training ML models.
