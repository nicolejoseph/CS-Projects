Game-playing program that uses artificial intelligence to play against a human user. 
This program combines iterative deepening and a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning, 
along with a heuristic function,to search the game space and decide each of its moves. 
Implemented with C++ on a simple ASCII interface.
